Please analyze the following recipe and format the output as a single-line JSON object that adheres to this JSON Schema: {"properties": {"recipe": {"description": "a list of ingredients and instructions", "type": "object", "properties": {"title": {"type": "string"}, "ingredients": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "instructions": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["title", "ingredients", "instructions"]}}. The JSON object should directly represent the recipe content, not the schema itself. Ensure that the JSON is formatted in a single line, with no newline characters ('\n') or other special formatting. It should strictly adhere to the schema without any formatting errors or trailing commas.
