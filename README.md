# Sample PALM2 prompt and response app.
- use `npm start` or `npm run dev`

### About App
- Pexel API: 
    - Pexel Image Api: Free image api. Restrictions: the API is rate-limited to 200 requests per hour and 20,000 requests per month. See: https://www.pexels.com/api/documentation/#photos-search
    - api route: `app.get('/api/pexel/image/:term'` -> `https://api.pexels.com/v1/search?query=${term}` 
- PALM2 API:
  - Where to get API key: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey 
  - Is it free? Yes, sorta: https://ngyibin.medium.com/how-to-get-access-to-googles-palm-2-large-language-model-21379f27c078#:~:text=At this stage%2C you may,use%2C unlike GPT-4. 
  - Google Cloud Console: for managing/view compute/usage stats https://console.cloud.google.com/ 
  - Basic Hello World: https://developers.generativeai.google/tutorials/text_node_quickstart 
  - Why not use Bard?
    - It doesn't consistently work with its cookie system: 
    - Resources if you want to work with Bard anyways: 
        - APIkey: As of 17 Nov, 2023 it is no longer available.
        - Getting Cookie: https://www.automatebard.com/2023/04/17/how-to-get-cookie-value-for-bard/ 
        - Basic Hello world: https://bard-ai.js.org/basics/ask/ 

## Important Notes
- GoogleAuth: to authenticate your apikey
- LLM Model Types used: `MODEL_NAME = "models/chat-bison-001";`
    - other types: https://developers.generativeai.google/models/language 
    - Model Tuning: https://developers.generativeai.google/guide/model_tuning_guidance
- LLM Libraries: 
    - DiscussServiceClient: full chat with ai. Has memory of prior conversations. Slow ETA 17s response time
    - TextServiceClient: simple prompt with ai. No memory of prior convos.Fast ETA 4s response time
        - Image: `getRecipeImage()` yeah this doesn't work. It just looks like a real link and very similar to a real one, but it's never a real working link

### dirty JSON responses: 
- added `( / to the ``` )` for readme visibility formatting purposes. It's triple backticks json then the actual json
- sometimes trailing commas in arrays
- trailing comma outside of json obj 
- Take note of the new lines, returns, tabs, spaces \n \r \t and a few other variations whe parsing

### Ai prompt rules config
- the prompt to the PALM2 

``` 
    let introStr = `Give me a recipe that includes: ${str}`
    let rulejson = sampleJSON;
    let query = `${introStr} ${str} ${rulejson}`
    
    //introStr gives simple context
    //str is the user input
    //below is the rulejson for how ai's prompt should respond. Based on LangChain's style
    
    
    
    Follow the instructions and format your response to match the format instructions, no matter what!
    You must format your output as a JSON value that adheres to a given "JSON Schema" instance.
    
    "JSON Schema" is a declarative language that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents.
    
    For example, the example "JSON Schema" instance {{"properties": {{"foo": {{"description": "a list of test words", "type": "array", "items": {{"type": "string"}}}}}}, "required": ["foo"]}}}}
    would match an object with one required property, "foo". The "type" property specifies "foo" must be an "array", and the "description" property semantically describes it as "a list of test words". The items within "foo" must be strings.
    Thus, the object {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is a well-formatted instance of this example "JSON Schema". The object {{"properties": {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}}}} is not well-formatted.
    
    Your output will be parsed and type-checked according to the provided schema instance, so make sure all fields in your output match the schema exactly and there are no trailing commas!
    
    Your output must be formatted exactly like this. The recipe object must have title, description, ingredients, instructions: 
    /```json{"recipe":{"title":"Carrots and Beans Stir Fry","description":"A delicious and nutritious stir fry with carrots and beans.","ingredients":"2 tablespoons olive oil, 1 clove garlic, minced, 1 teaspoon ginger, grated, Salt and pepper to taste, Soy sauce for flavor (optional),","instructions":"Step1. Heat olive oil in a pan over medium heat., Step2. Add minced garlic and grated ginger. Saut√© until fragrant., Step3 Add sliced carrots and chopped green beans to the pan., Step4 Stir fry the vegetables until they are tender but still crisp."}} /```

```
